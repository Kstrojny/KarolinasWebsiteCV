        <h1>Work History</h1>
        <h3>Hub of Hospitality</h3>
        <p class="textbox">Since 2015, I have been masternig my hospitality skills. Communication
            and teamwork are my bread and butter. Working with people can be a challenge especially in 
            fast paced environments of ever changing needs and requests.

        <h3>Hyatt Regency O'Hare</h3>
        <h4 class="date">March 2015 - June 2020</h4>
        <p class="textbox">It all began in 2015 in Chicago working at a large
            airport and convention center hotel that has 1,095 rooms. A 4 star
            hotel that often housed business travelers, stranded passengeres from cancelled
            flights in one of America's largest airports and large scale conventions.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">During my time at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare, I started as 
            a front desk host and quickly moved up the ranks to management. When COVID 
            hit in 2020, I finished my career there as an Assistant Front Office Manager. 
            I was the contact point for multiple clients that were contracted with us. 
            Oversaw 30 staff members from 4 different operational departments and ensured brand and quality standards were
            held accross the board. I assisted in training new employees, delegating tasks,
            and shared feedback. Even back then, before I had any coding knowledge, I worked
            though OPERA to create reports that helped us boost our customer service rankings
            by tracking guest satisfaction surveys. After implimenting the knowledge from my reports, guest satisfaction increased 
            from 72% to 84%.</p>

        <p class="textbox">Every weekend we would welcome thousands of new guests and almost
            every weeknight, we welcomed the hundreds of people that sometimes all showed at once
            from cancelations at the airport. I treat every person as an individual with their own
            needs and requests and work with my team and multiple departments to ensure a hassle
            free stay.

        <h3>Andaz Amsterdam</h3>
        <h4 class="date">July 2021 - Current</h4>
        <p class="textbox">
            The Andaz Amsterdam is a 5 star boutque hotel with only 122 rooms 
            which allows for a more intimate environment. Here, I focus on the 
            relationships we have with guests and am a contact point not for a group,
            but for an individual. I am in communication with a guest from before they
            arrive until their day of departure, helping plan a the perfect 
            stay in Amsterdam whatever that may mean to them.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">In addition to working with guests and as concierge, I am
            the head of our enrollment program. My responsibility in this area is to 
            track the amount of people who sign up to become members of our hotel and 
            create strategies to motivate the front desk to enroll them. I compare the 
            data given by our headquarters to the opportunities at hand and ensure we 
            reach our goals. Last year our goal was 23% enrollment rate and under my
            partial leadership we ended at 32%.
