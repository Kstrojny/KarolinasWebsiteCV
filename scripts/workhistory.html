        <h1>Work History</h1>
        <h3>Hub of Hospitality</h3>
        <p class="textbox">Since 2015, I have been masternig my hospitality skills. Communication
            and teamwork are my bread and butter. Working with people can be hard especially in 
            fast paced environments of ever changing needs and requests.
        </p>
        <h3>Hyatt Regency O'Hare</h3>
        <p class="textbox">It all began in 2015 in Chicago working at a large
            airport and convention center hotel that has 1,095 rooms. It was a 4 star
            hotel that often housed business travelers, stranded passengeres from cancelled
            flights in one of America's largest airports and large scale conventions.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">During my time at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare, I started as 
            a front desk host and when COVID hit in 2020, I finished my career there
            as an Assistant Front Office Manager. I was the contact point for multiple 
            clients that were contracted with us. Oversaw 30 staff members from 4
            different operational departments and ensured brand and quality standards were
            held accross the board. I assisted in training new employees, delegating tasks,
            and share feedback. Even back then before I had any coding knowledge, I worked
            though OPERA yo create reports that helped us boost our customer service rankings.
            After implimenting the knowledge from my reports, guest satisfaction increased 
            from 72% to 84%.</p>
            <p class="textbox">You might be wondering how can hospitality be integrated
                into the world of IT? There is a huge opportunity here for hiring people
                from hospitality into a world of computers and date. Like mentioned before,
                I come from a background of people and am always in a place of problem solving
                and thinking outside the box while being aware of our standard practices. I'm familiar
                with managing large amounts of data and multitasking on multiple platforms that all
                interconnent to create the perfect stay for our guest from the front while working
                on any issues in the back.

        <p class="textbox">Every weekend we would welcome thousands of new guests and almost
            every weeknight, we welcomed the hundreds of people that sometimes all showed at once
            from cancelations at the airport. I treat every person as an individual with their own
            needs and requests and work with my team and multiple departments to ensure a hassle
            free stay.
