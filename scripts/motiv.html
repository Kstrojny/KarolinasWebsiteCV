        <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p class="textbox solo">You may be thinking to yourself, "Why would someone with minor coding experience
            want to turn their career path a full 180?" It was during the pandemic that started to get the ball rolling.
            </p>
            <span class="smolbody">
            <p class="textbox">It began as a curiosity to invent a prompting device for my car which introduced
            me to the world of coding with Arduino and using robotics. I found great joy and accomplishment
            in my C++ projects and with no main focus in mind, I moved onto other areas like you
            can see here with HTML and CSS and making my way towards Javascript. Coding 
            is something that I have been enjoying as a hobby and want to focus on that hobby to make it into my career.
            </p>
            <p class="textbox under">There aren't many people out there enjoying what they do for work and my time 
            in hospitality has come. I only need to enter through the door of IT whether that be 
            data engineering, testing, or back end development. I've researched and heard of
            many success stories from people at Calco and they praise the opportunities they
            were given by being offered the option to complete the traineeship.
            </p>
            <p class="textbox under">You would be adding someone to the team who has a background in communicating with
            teams of people and always problem solving. Someone who is familiar with managing large 
            amounts of data and multitasking on multiple platforms. I know that
            my enthusiasm and goals are in line with what Calco wants and hope we can work
            together to accomplish our goals.
            </p>
