            some of my hobbys, from coding to making little websites like this 
            but when I'm not sitting inside staring at a screen, I'm outside enjoying
             the World.

        <h2 class="titles">Cycling</h2>
        <p class="textbox">One of the main things I love about living in The Netherlands
            is the freedom of cycling. I recently completed my longest cycle which was from
            Amsterdam to Rotterdam and am preparing to do a cycling tour from Groningen to
            Maastricht.

        <h2 class="titles">Architecture</h2>
        <p class="textbox">While cycling, I get a prime view of all the architecture Europe
            has to offer. My favorite style of architecture being Gothic. A recent trip to
            Edinbrugh really blew my mind with their city design and detail put into their
            monument, buildings, and castles.
