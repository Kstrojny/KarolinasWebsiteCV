        <h1>Hobbys</h1>
        <p class="textbox">By this point, you have already seen some of my hobbys, from
            coding to making little websites like this but when I'm not sitting inside
            staring at a screen, I'm outside enjoying the World.

        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <p class="textbox">One of the main things I love about living in The Netherlands
            is the freedom of cycling. I recently completed my longest cycle which was from
            Amsterdam to Rotterdam and am preparing to do a cycling tour from Groningen to
            Maastricht.

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p class="textbox">While cycling, I get a prime view of all the architecture Europe
            has to offer. My favorite style of architecture being Gothic. A recent trip to
            Edinbrugh really blew my mind with their city design and detail put into their
            monument, buildings, and castles.
