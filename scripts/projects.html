            <p class="textbox">The year was 2020, well into the pandemic and my mind started to tinker. The winter season
                just started and everything was on lockdown. I had an idea for an invention, <em>"The 
                Rear Window Text Box"</em> for drivers. It would be a screen that would sit in your car's 
                back window that you can program to communicate to the driver behind you. Things like
                "let me pass" and "thank you for letting me pass".
            </p>
            <p class="textbox">
                I started to look into making this a reality
                and came accross someone who had the idea before me and created it using <strong style="color:RGB(0,151,157);">Arduino</strong>. 
                Of course I purchased a self teaching kit right away and got to work. The video below sums up
                my journey from unboxing to building a Smart Greenhouse model.

            <p class="textbox">I loved working with my hands and getting a grasp on learning coding 
                languages. I even made little projects for fun just to see what I could do.

            <p class="textbox">After completing the course, I even tried making my own 2D platforming game
                but my interests lay elsewhere. Enter <em>The Odin Project</em>.

        <h3 class="header3 odin">The Odin Project</h3>
            <p class="textbox">The Odin Project is an open source curriculum that starts you
                off with HTML and CSS before you branch off to either full stack Ruby on Rails or
                Full Stack Javascript. As of the 10th of April, I'm only a few days away from my first
                Javascript course.
            </p>
            <p class="textbox">I started learning here only a few weeks ago and this website that you're
                navigatinig through now is a showcase of what I have learned so far. Along with HTML and CSS, I am
                also familiar with Git and GitHub. I run Ubunthu off of my Windows laptop and am
                familiar with installing and running emulators and commiting my changes onto my Git repos.
                You can find my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Kstrojny<">here</a>.
