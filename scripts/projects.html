            <p class="textbox">The year was 2020, well into the pandemic and my mind started to tinker. The winter season
                just started and everything was on lockdown. I had an idea for an invention, <em>"The 
                Rear Window Text Box"</em> for drivers. It would be a screen that would sit in your car's 
                back window that you can program to communicate to the driver behind you. Things like
                "let me pass" and "thank you for letting me pass". I started to look into making this a reality
                and came accross someone who had the idea before me and created it using <bold>Arduino</bold>. 
                Of course I purchased a self teaching kit right away and got to work. The video below sums up
                y journey from unboxing to building a theoretical robotically operational green house.

            <p class="textbox">I loved working with my hands and getting a grasp on learning coding 
                languages. I even made little projects for fun.

            <p class="textbox">After completing the course, I even tried making my own 2D platforming game
                but my interests lay elsewhere. Enter <em>The Odin Project</em>.
