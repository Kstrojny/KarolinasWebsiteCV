My Application to change your mind at Calco and bring me on to your team

Dear all who read this,

My name is Karolina and for my whole adult life I have worked in hotels in the service
of others. Long have been the days and nights, fulfilling your requests and working
in a forever changing environment, multitasking.. communicating. 

Life is pretty great but can there be more?

YES

In 2020 I started learning code on my own and have found a passion for creation and problem solving digitally.

This website is a dedication to that passion in hopes to change the minds at Calco to so kindly offer me the chance to change my life and introduce me to the real world of
IT through their English traineeship. 

Thank you for any time you spend seeing my work.

Warmest regards,
Karolina S.
